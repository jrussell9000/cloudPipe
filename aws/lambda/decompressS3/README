This directory contains an exported AWS Lambda function, abcdUnpack.zip that will 
perform GZip decompression on a gzipped S3 object, then delete it.

The lambda function is triggered by ANY s3:ObjectCreated event to a given S3 bucket
(e.g., abcd-mri). Running this function therefore requires that the execution role
have permissions on that bucket.  

This was originally used to decompress all the compressed ABCD imaging files 
while keeping them on S3. It was triggered by doing an aws cp --recursive copy between
a bucket/prefix containing the compressed files and an output bucket (abcd-mri).

It might be faster to use boto3.s3.transfer or an s3 batch operation, but I couldn't get the
latter to work and didn't have the time to try the former.  


fastUnpack contains alternative versions I was testing that may or may not actually work.
