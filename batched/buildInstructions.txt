These files integrate with the FastSurfer github repository to 
create a docker image containing a cloud-based processing pipeline for ABCD participants.

This requires changes to the Dockerfile in the FastSurfer repository and 
the addition of an 'abcd' folder to the <FastSurferRepo>/Docker directory.

After cloning the repository (into, e.g., 'FastSurfer'), copy the Dockerfile in this directory to 
FastSurfer/Docker, replacing the original. Then make a directory 'abcd' in FastSurfer/Docker. Copy all
files in this directory (except the Dockerfile) to the new 'abcd' directory. 

From the FastSurfer/Docker folder run (as of 071224):
python build.py --device cu118 --tag <image tag> --target runtime

An example tag might be jrussell9000/abcdfast_eks_batch:071224
